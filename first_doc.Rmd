I FORGOT TO ADD THIS LINE IN MY PREVIOUS COMMIT!! 

This report documents my first attempts at using Git and GitHub to version control an RStudio project. I will be modifying this report, staging and commiting changes and then pushing to GitHub.

Let's create a test plot of distance (miles) and speed (mph)

```{r, test-plot}
plot(cars, col = "blue", xlab = "speed (mph)", ylab = "distance (miles)")
```

```

A summary of the data frame is given below

```{r, cars-summary}
library(knitr)
kable(summary(cars))
```
